/** \mainpage

This is the API manual for the <a href="https://github.com/fmrchallenge/fmrbenchmark">fmrbenchmark repository</a>,
 which is part of a <a href="https://fmrchallenge.org">project</a> to develop benchmark problems for research in
so-called "formal methods for robotics." This API manual is of interest if you
will extend, modify, or in general, work directly with the source code of the
various benchmarks and supporting infrastructure. For installation instructions,
introductions about usage, and examples, consult the <a href="http://docs.fmrchallenge.org">User's Guide</a>.

\warning The API is not stable. No part of it can be considered stable until
version 0.1.0.  Beginning at that time, the API manual will include details
about whether or how parts of the API may change.

\section sec_problem_domains Problem domains

\subsection sec_integrator_chains Scaling chains of integrators

For details, consult the API module \ref integrator_chains.

\subsection sec_dubins_traffic Traffic network of Dubins cars
