<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>We present the first challenge on formal methods for robotics, which will be
held at <a href="http://www.icra2015.org/">ICRA 2015</a> as
a <a href="http://www.icra2015.org/conference/robot-challenges">Robot
Challenge</a>.  Formal methods refers broadly to techniques for the verification
and automatic synthesis of transition systems that satisfy desirable properties
exactly or within some statistical tolerance.  Though historically developed for
concurrent software, recent work has brought these methods to bear on motion
planning in robotics.  Challenges specific to robotics, such as uncertainty and
real-time constraints, have motivated extensions to existing methods and
entirely novel treatments.  However, compared to other areas within robotics
research, demonstrations of formal methods have been surprisingly small-scale.
The proposed robotics challenge seeks to motivate advancement of the state of
the art toward practical realization.  The challenge is organized into three
problem domains: arbitrary dimensional double integrators, roads with Dubins
cars, and manipulation tasks on the assembly line.</p>

The <em>scaling double integrators</em> domain is the simplest in terms of
dynamics, yet unlike the other domains, the system to be controlled can be
scaled easily to arbitrarily many dimensions.  While this problem is abstract in
the sense that it is not modeling a specific physical system, it is
well-motivated because the double-integrator is just the basic force equation
\( F=ma \) of Newtonian mechanics, up to a scaling factor.  In other words, this
problem domain concerns acceleration of a point-mass in high-dimensional spaces
so as to visit goal regions and avoid obstacles.

<div class="psetting" id="dubinstraffic">
<h3>Dubins traffic</h3>
<p>

The <em>Dubins traffic</em> domain involves navigation in a small network of
two-lane roads with vehicles that have Dubins car dynamics.  There is an
adversary that selects the motion of other cars.  The adversary is subject to
assumptions such as obeying traffic rules and not parking unfairly at locations
that must be eventually reached by the controller.

<h3>pick-and-place</h3>
<p>

<img src="img/pandp_illustration.png" width="275px" alt="Illustration of a Baxter robot next to an empty table.  The arms are hanging downward and not in motion." />
The <em>pick-and-place</em> domain concerns dexterous manipulation tasks
motivated by assembly line activities.  The difficulties present in this problem
domain will include uncertainty in the shape and dynamics of the end-effector,
as well as objects that are being grasped, and collision-avoidance with moving
obstacles that come into the workspace.
