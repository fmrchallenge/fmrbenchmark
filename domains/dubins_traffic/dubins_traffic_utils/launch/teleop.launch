<!-- Manual steering of the ego vehicle.

This launch file requires the kobuki_keyop ROS package to be installed. However,
manual steering is not a part of the benchmark and is provided primarily for
low-level debugging. Thus, kobuki_keyop is not listed as a dependency in
package.xml of dubins_traffic_utils.
