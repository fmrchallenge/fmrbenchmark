/** \defgroup integrator_chains Problem domain: Scaling chains of integrators

Problems in this domain require construction of a controller---if one
exists---for a chain of integrators so that resulting trajectories satisfy a
reach-and-avoid specification.

Our treatment here focuses on the programming interface. The notation and
relevant theory is developed in the <a href="http://fmrchallenge.org/norm">benchmark specification</a>,
and a tutorial introduction is given in the <a href="http://docs.fmrchallenge.org">User's Guide</a>.
