User's Guide
============

This is the User's Guide to the `fmrbenchmark repository
<https://github.com/fmrchallenge/fmrbenchmark>`_, which is part of a project to
develop benchmark problems for research in so-called "formal methods for
robotics."  This effort is stimulated by competitions, and the main website is
https://fmrchallenge.org. The two other major forms of documentation are the `API
manual <http://api.fmrchallenge.org>`_ and the `benchmark specifications
<https://fmrchallenge.org/norm>`_.  Among the latter documents are competition
rules. Besides these sources of documentation, there are comments in the code as
well as README and similar files throughout the repository.

For newcomers, a good place to begin is the :doc:`intro`.
