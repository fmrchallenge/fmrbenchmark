/** \defgroup dubins_traffic Problem domain: Traffic network of Dubins cars

Problems in this domain involve navigation in a small network of two-lane roads
with vehicles that have Dubins car dynamics.

Our treatment here focuses on the programming interface. The notation and
relevant theory is developed in the <a href="https://fmrchallenge.org/norm">benchmark specification</a>,
and a tutorial introduction is given in the <a href="http://docs.fmrchallenge.org">User's Guide</a>.
